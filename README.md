# Bondage Framework
A collection of low level changes for the game Odyssey of Gianna.

Most of them centered around a theme, but always optional.

## Features

1. Difficulty options: Safely change the difficulty at any time from the game's options. It won't break your save.
2. Hell mode: Hard mode but with much stronger enemies, restricted fast travel, and more dangerous ambushes.
3. Inherent skills: Makes some class-specific skills inherent to the party member. This is toggled on by default, but can be disabled in the `config.json` file.

## Install Instructions

1. Download the mod from this [link](https://github.com/giannan-mods/bondage-framework/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for the latest changes.
2. Unzip and drop the folder into the `mods` folder.
3. Launch the game and activate the mod.
